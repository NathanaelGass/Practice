Coding screen for Pandell. Algorithm implemented utilizes linear run time and space complexity while performing a randomization of array elements, which are the numbers 1-10000 in thise case.

Additionally contains unit test for the array.

Since no specific return format was listed, the program prints the numbers to the console, one line at a time.
